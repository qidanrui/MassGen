OpenAI:
- chat history keep adding assistant message, without adding user MESSAGES
- Check the work_on_task function

Grok:
- chat history has new user messages, but not in correct order
- Check the work_on_task function

Gemini:
- Tool swap not finished
- Check the work_on_task function

Prompt:
- Make summary report complete, self-contained
- Reuse the instructions

Vote (fixed):
- No unique votes for each agent
- vote_counts is not correct: should be {"agent_id": "vote_count"}, start with 0
- vote_distribution should be kept
- voted_agents should be the number of agents whose current status is "voted"

TODO:
- Check work_on_task function for each agent (add notification)
- Fix the bug for gemini tool conflict
- logging file figured out (folder, log.txt)

Display and loggings:
- where are all the information stored?
- Multi-region display:
 - add border (上下左右) to every region
 - region border should always be strict (but now it is not)
 - for each region (agents and system), display their useful state information in real-time, like phase, status, vote_target, please refer to mass/types.py for useful agent and system state.
 - in the bottom part where we display system events. Can you also add an emoji indicate the agent status change? Like before: Agent 2: working → voted, add an emoji
