> 🧠 **Multi-agent scaling through intelligent collaboration in Grok Heavy style**

MassGen is a cutting-edge multi-agent system that leverages the power of collaborative AI to solve complex tasks. It assigns a task to multiple AI agents who work in parallel, observe each other's progress, and refine their approaches to converge on the best solution to deliver a comprehensive and high-quality result. The power of this "parallel study group" approach is exemplified by advanced systems like xAI's Grok Heavy and Google DeepMind's Gemini Deep Think.
This project started with the "threads of thought" and "iterative refinement" ideas presented in [The Myth of Reasoning](https://docs.ag2.ai/latest/docs/blog/#the-myth-of-reasoning), and extends the classic "multi-agent conversation" idea in [AG2](https://github.com/ag2ai/ag2).

## 🏗️ System Design

MassGen operates through a sophisticated architecture designed for **seamless multi-agent collaboration**:

    subgraph Collaborative Agents
        A1[Agent 1<br/>🏗️ Anthropic/Claude + Tools]

    end

    classDef agent fill:#f3e5f5,stroke:#7b1fa2,stroke-width:2px

    class O orchestrator
    class A1,A2,A3,A4 agent
    class H hub
```

The system's workflow is defined by the following key principles:

**Parallel Processing** - Multiple agents tackle the same task simultaneously, each leveraging their unique capabilities (different models, tools, and specialized approaches).

**Real-time Collaboration** - Agents continuously share their working summaries and insights through a notification system, allowing them to learn from each other's approaches and build upon collective knowledge.

**Convergence Detection** - The system intelligently monitors when agents have reached stability in their solutions and achieved consensus through natural collaboration rather than forced agreement.

**Adaptive Coordination** - Agents can restart and refine their work when they receive new insights from others, creating a dynamic and responsive problem-solving environment.

This collaborative approach ensures that the final output leverages collective intelligence from multiple AI systems, leading to more robust and well-rounded results than any single agent could achieve alone.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. 📥 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Leezekun/MassGen.git
cd MassGen
pip install uv
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
uv pip install -e .
```

### 2. 🔐 API Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the `massgen/backends/` directory with your API keys:

```bash
# Copy example configuration
cp massgen/backends/.env.example massgen/backends/.env

# Edit with your API keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key-here
XAI_API_KEY=xai-your-xai-key-here
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-key-here
```

Make sure you set up the API key for the model you want to use.

**Useful links to get API keys:**
 - [Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs)
 - [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
 - [Grok](https://docs.x.ai/docs/overview)

### 3. 🧩 Supported Models and Tools

<!-- What does the following mean? If it can be clarified, then we can uncomment -->
<!-- Configure the models you wish to use by updating the model registry in `massgen/utils.py`.  -->

#### Models

The system currently supports three model providers with advanced reasoning capabilities: **Google Gemini**, **OpenAI**, and **xAI Grok**. The specific models tested can be found in `massgen/utils.py`. Additional models can be registered in that file.
More providers and local inference of open-sourced models (using vllm or sglang) will be added (help wanted!) and the extension will be made easier.

#### Tools

MassGen agents can leverage various tools to enhance their problem-solving capabilities. The Gemini, OpenAI, and Grok models can use their own built-in search and code execution. You can easily extend functionality by registering custom tools in `massgen/tools.py`.

**Supported Built-in Tools by Models:**

| Backend | Live Search | Code Execution |
|---------|:-----------:|:--------------:|
| **Gemini** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **OpenAI** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Grok** | ✅ | ❌ |

> 🔧 **Custom Tools**: More tools are coming soon! Check `massgen/tools.py` to add your own custom tools and expand agent capabilities.

### 4. 🏃 Run MassGen

#### Simple Usage
```bash
# Multi-agent mode with specific models
python cli.py "Which AI won IMO in 2025?" --models gemini-2.5-flash gpt-4o

# Single agent mode
python cli.py "What is greatest common divisor of 238, 756, and 1512" --models gemini-2.5-flash
```

#### Configuration File Usage

# Use configuration file
python cli.py --config examples/fast_config.yaml "find big AI news this week"

# Override specific parameters
python cli.py --config examples/fast_config.yaml "who will win World Cup 2026" --max-duration 120 --consensus 0.5
```

#### Configuration Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `--config` | Path to YAML configuration file with agent setup, model parameters, and orchestrator settings |
| `--models` | Space-separated model names. Single model enables single-agent mode; multiple models enable collaborative multi-agent mode |
| `--consensus` | Consensus threshold (0.0-1.0) for multi-agent agreement. Unmet thresholds trigger continued debate and refinement |
| `--max-duration` | Maximum session execution time in seconds before automatic termination |
| `--max-debates` | Maximum number of debate rounds allowed when agents fail to reach consensus |
| `--no-display` | Disable real-time streaming display of agent progress |

**Note**: `--config` and `--models` are mutually exclusive - use one or the other.

#### Interactive Multi-turn Mode

MassGen supports an interactive mode where you can have ongoing conversations with the system:

```bash
# Start interactive mode with multiple agents
python cli.py --models gpt-4o gemini-2.5-flash grok-3-mini

# Start interactive mode with configuration file
python cli.py --config examples/fast_config.yaml

# Interactive mode with custom parameters
